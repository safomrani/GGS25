This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server :

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment Variables for Registration Forms

To use the registration forms in this project, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project with the following variables:

```
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_VENUE_ID=your_venue_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_TICKET_TIER_ID=your_ticket_tier_id
```

These variables are used in the following registration forms:
- Free Ticket Registration: `/summit25/registration`
- Speaker Registration: `/summit25/speaker-registration`

Both forms support pre-filling email via URL query parameters: `?email=example@example.com&tenant_id=your_tenant_id`
